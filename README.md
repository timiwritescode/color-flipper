# color-flipper
A simple color switch button which allows you to play around with random color change

Programmers (maybe newbies) sometimes, during development, wonder about the outcome of their color choices or maybe even run out of ideas for which color combinations to use for their background. 

Or maybe someway, somehow, switching between colors calms your anxiety and makes you feel good (probably doesn't). This project was done with you in mind.

How it works?
You have three different modes.

Simple Mode:
There is a button that changes (when clicked) background into a random color. The color change is represented in RGB values.

Hex mode (Default):
Same as the simple mode except the color change is represnted in hex values.

Custom mode:
The almighty custom mode allows you to mix the colors yourself. 

Bon appetite!
